## MongoDB + Beego Development Environment

### Requirements
You need to install docker and docker-compose

> If you are using docker-machine, look for the machine IP address with the command `docker-machine ls`

### How to run the project
In the console run `docker-compose up` and it will do the heavylifting to start your app

### Where is the source code?
angular4/code, contains the source code for the frontend app
beego/code, contains the source code for the beego API app

the folders *code* for angular4 and beego must be created

### How to access the services

| *URL* | *Application* |
|---  | ----------- |
| http://localhost:8081/ | beego          |
| http://localhost:8000/ | mongo-express  |
| http://localhost:4200/ | angular4       |
| http://localhost:8088/ | swagger-editor |

### How to link dev environment with the angular4 and beego code
You must create a symlink replacing the code folder for the original source code

`angular4/code` contains the code for the angular4 client
`beego/code` contains the code for the beego project

```
ln -s <path to your project> angular4/code
ln -s <path to your project> beego/code
```
